# netflixmovietracker
A project in my very first programming with Python class, which involves analyzing and visualizing some characteristics of the dataset of movies released on Netflix in 2016.
At first, we approached it in a very traditional way with the limited knowledge we learned in class, that means creating a lot of dictionaries and somewhat writing very lengthy code.
After a year and two more comprehensive programming courses, I finally redid everything. It can still be further improved but I'm much more satisfied with this version than our clumpsy work last year.
