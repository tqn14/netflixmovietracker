Objectives: analyzing and visualizing some characteristics of the dataset of movies released on Netflix in 2016: 
- General information about the dataset (number of movies released, number of different genres, number of distributors..)
- Bar chart of number of movies released each month
- Line chart of number of movies released each month by genres (drama movies outnumber any other genres)
- Pie chart of percentages of ticket sold by each distributors (the majority of tickets sold belongs to big names such as Warner Bros., Walt Disney)

At first, we approached it in a very traditional way with the limited knowledge we learned in class by creating a lot of dictionaries and somewhat writing very lengthy code.
After a year and two more comprehensive programming courses, I finally redid everything. It can still be further improved but I'm much more satisfied with this version than our clumpsy work last year.
