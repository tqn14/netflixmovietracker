Objectives: analyzing and visualizing some characteristics of the dataset of 700 movies released on Netflix in 2016: 
- General information about the dataset (number of movies released, number of different genres, number of distributors..)
- Bar chart of number of movies released each month
- Line chart of number of movies released each month by genres (drama movies outnumber any other genres)
- Pie chart of percentages of ticket sold by each distributors (the majority of tickets sold belongs to big names such as Warner Bros., Walt Disney)

Assumptions: 
- All entries have been filled and formatted 
- If a movie falls into to multiple genres, choose the major genre based on how it is advertised/categorized on Netflix

Most people went to the movies in the summer of 2016, based on the number of tickets sold shooting up from May to July. The line then plummets in months preceding peak seasons (April and October)

It seems like the total number of movies released each month follows the same trends of the number of tickets sold, however; even though a lot of movies were released in April and October, it didn't make so many people want to go see them

Some of the biggest brand names in the movie industry stand out in this pie chart such as Universal, Warner Bros, Walt Disney. 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures made up a comparable fraction of the total amount. Other independent firms that sold below 1% of the total tickets were summed up in the "Others" category, which accounts for approx. 6% of the total revenue.

Surprisingly, Netflix released more Drama movies in 2016 than any other genres on their platform, followed up by Comedy. The least released were those of Horror. Drama movies were also released the most on Spring and Fall season, while Comedy ones were approximately out all year round. Same with Horror movies. For Action movies, they were mostly released in the Summer.
