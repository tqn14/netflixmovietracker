Objectives: analyzing and visualizing some characteristics of the dataset of 700 movies released on Netflix in 2016: 
- General information about the dataset (number of movies released, number of different genres, number of distributors..)
- Bar chart of number of movies released each month
- Line chart of number of movies released each month by genres (drama movies outnumber any other genres)
- Pie chart of percentages of ticket sold by each distributors (the majority of tickets sold belongs to big names such as Warner Bros., Walt Disney)

Assumptions: 
- All entries have been filled and formatted 
- If a movie falls into to multiple genres, choose the major genre based on how it is advertised/categorized on Netflix

Most people often go to the movies in the summer, based on the number of tickets sold shooting up from May to July. The line then plummets in months preceding peak seasons (such as April and October)
